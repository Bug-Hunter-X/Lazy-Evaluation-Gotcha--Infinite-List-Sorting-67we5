This Haskell code suffers from a common error related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures:

```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1..]  -- Infinite list
  let ys = sort xs
  print (take 5 ys) -- This will never terminate
```

The problem is that `sort` attempts to traverse the entire `xs` list before producing any output, even though we only want the first five elements. Because `xs` is infinite, the sorting never completes.
